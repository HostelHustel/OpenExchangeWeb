## üîÑ Common Workflows

### When a Buy/Exchange Request is Accepted by the Seller

When a seller approves a transaction request via `/requests/:id/approve`:

1. The request status changes from "pending" to "approved"
2. The API response includes contact details of both parties:
   ```json
   {
      "request": { /* request details */ },
      "seller_contact": "seller's contact information",
      "buyer_contact": "buyer's contact information"
   }
   ```
3. The frontend should display these contact details to both users so they can arrange the transaction in person
4. **Privacy Note**: Contact details are only revealed after explicit approval by the seller

### When a Requested Item is Fulfilled

When a seller fulfills a requested item via `/requested-items/fulfill`:

1. A new item is automatically created in the system
2. A transaction request is automatically created with status "pending"
3. The requested item's status changes from "open" to "fulfilled"
4. The buyer gets notified that someone has fulfilled their request
5. The buyer must then approve the transaction request through the regular flow
6. Once approved, contact details are revealed to both parties

## üîí Security Notes

- Authentication is handled via JWT tokens
- Tokens must be included in the `Authorization` header for authenticated routes
- Contact details are only revealed after explicit approval of transactions
- All sensitive routes require authentication

## üß© Data Models

- **User**: Contains name, email, password (hashed), contact details, hostel info
- **Item**: Contains title, description, price, image, status, type (sell/exchange)
- **TransactionRequest**: Details about a transaction between buyer and seller
- **RequestedItem**: An item a buyer is looking for but isn't currently available
- **Hostel**: Contains hostel name and ID

## üìù Additional Notes

- Items require admin approval before appearing in listings
- Users can request specific items they're looking for
- Transaction requests can be for buying or exchanging items
- Contact between users happens outside the platform after a request is approved

| Method | Endpoint | Function | Description |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/services` | `ListServices` | List all approved services offered by users |
| POST | `/services` | `CreateService` | Create a new service offering |
| GET | `/my-services` | `GetMyServices` | List all services created by the authenticated user |

## Common Service Workflows

### When a User Offers a Service

1. User creates a service offering via `/services`
2. Admin approves the service via `/admin/services/:id/approve`
3. Service becomes visible to all users in the marketplace

### When a User Requests a Service

1. User creates a service request via `/service-requests`
2. The request appears in the service request listings
3. Another user can accept the request via `/service-requests/:id/accept`
4. When accepted, contact details are revealed to both parties
5. Once the service is completed, the requester marks it complete via `/service-requests/:id/complete`

### Contact Information Sharing

- For service requests, contact information is shared when a provider accepts a request
- This allows requester and provider to communicate directly about the service
- The system response includes both parties' contact details
