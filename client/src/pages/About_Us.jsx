          <p className="text-lg mb-6">
            HOSTEL HUSTLE was born out of a simple yet powerful realization—students in hostels often struggle to find essential items when they need them the most. Whether it’s a late-night snack, a last-minute lab coat, or a borrowed calculator, finding the right thing at the right time can be a challenge. We built HOSTEL HUSTLE to solve this problem by creating a seamless platform for students to buy, sell, and exchange items within their hostel community.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">A PLATFORM BUILT BY STUDENTS, FOR STUDENTS</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            What started as a small idea quickly turned into a full-fledged open-source project. We assembled a team of passionate coders and innovators who believed in the mission of making hostel life easier. Today, HOSTEL HUSTLE is an ever-growing community-driven platform that thrives on collaboration and innovation.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-left">
            <li>Users sign in and select their hostel.</li>
            <li>They browse a list of approved items available for trade, purchase, or exchange.</li>
            <li>Buyers send requests to sellers, who can approve or decline them.</li>
            <li>All items listed for sale go through an admin approval process to ensure quality and relevance.</li>
            <li>Exchanges allow users to propose and negotiate direct item swaps.</li>
